                        The BEST chicken soup you’ll ever eat is the perfect recipe to make when you’re feeling sick. Packed with anti-inflammatory ingredients like ginger, turmeric, garlic. This is the BEST CHICKEN SOUP RECIPE EVER!
                        I’ve been a soup lover my entire life. Tony would tell you that it’s true because he’s the one stuck eating my delicious soup recipes that I bust out weekly.
                        This chicken soup recipe came to me after I came down with the WORST cold ever. I was on the verge of getting better, then all of a sudden I took a turn for the worst and spent an entire weekend sneezing, coughing and barely able to breathe.

                        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus).
                        In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.

                        Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice," also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.
